Salutations to God
Salutations of love
To all people
It is God who
Has blessed us
Guided us in
His attitude, values and behaviour

It is god who has
Bestowed upon us
These treasures upon
The face of this earth
As the right path 
For us to walk, from the time we sneeze the breath of life


Let us mature
In this lifeâ€™s journey
As we blossom
In the language
Of the Moriori
That the lives 
Of our ancestors
Will have been of great worth
The example they set
For a path we can follow, from the time
We breathe the breath of life

Uplift and utilise
This deep purpose
That the stand of Moriori
Will forever be
